# TKR
A remastered version of TK

# Notes
I think that this src could be alot better
Its built upon the corpse of another 2 bases so its not my best work, Hopefully you can learn something from it?

# Possible Issues
This source's development was abbruptly stopped so some things may be wack.
There is expected to be a few bugs lingering its not perfect, I will try to fix them as they come in/when i can be bothered
Pretty sure 7.0 client has a memory leak still undecided
Some Entities might be bugged havent tested fully
IDR if theres and player hit/entity bugs
Some entities are using new and some old movement code, never fully transitioned
